# LegionsWH40k

A project to reinforce swift-lessons in the "WarHammer 40k universe":
- TableView, CollectionView, MVC-model, URLRequests, webView

P.s.
It also helps me not to get confused by a lot of information and characters in "Warhammer-books".

The task of the project is to show a list of legions, their leader and pictures with minimal information.
Later I added minor faction screens that open their wiki-pages and gallery-screen.
